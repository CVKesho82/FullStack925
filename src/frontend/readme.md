# **WELCOME TO ADULTING**
## ***The StackOverflow...for Life!***

Adulting is a web application that provides a forum to ask and answer
questions surrounding being an adult and the adult processes we have to take on. 

As this application, server, and database needed to be built within a 2 week timeframe, phase 1 of the adulting app will contain a streamlined repostory of topics including: Car Buying/Maintenance and Home Buying/Maintance.

## FUTURE ASPIRATIONS

The sky is the limit as far as building out this application, server and database. As more questions and topics come in, we can work to categorize them and place the questions and answers, by topic, into our database. 

## BUSINESS APPLICATION - ***Who is this web application for?***

These are many use cases for the application/API, but here are a few
    - Developers who are developing real estate websites who want to incorporate frequently asked questions
    - Developers who are developing automotive sales websites who want to incorporate frequently asked questions regarding car buying
